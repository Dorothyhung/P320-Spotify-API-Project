## About Spotify Audio Features

Spotify provides a range of audio features that describe various aspects of a track's musical content. These features include acousticness (how acoustic a track is), danceability (how suitable a track is for dancing), energy (how energetic a track feels), and many more. Understanding these features can deepen your appreciation for music and help you discover new favorites.
